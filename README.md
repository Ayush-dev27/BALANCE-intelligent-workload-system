BALANCE is a decision-support system designed to intelligently track workload and estimate burnout risk using explainable, rule-based logic.
Unlike typical task managers, BALANCE considers:
Task difficulty
Planned hours
Daily capacity
Fatigue accumulation
Risk classification
The goal is sustainable productivity through measurable workload control.
⚙️ Tech Stack
Python (Backend Logic)
MySQL (Database)
HTML/CSS/JS (Frontend – in progress)
🏗 Architecture
